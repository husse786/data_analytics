# Business Case and Problem definition

## Use Case 1: Price Prediction Model for Rental Apartments in the Canton of Zürich

### 1. Problem Definition
- Asking rents are set inconsistently across municipalities (Gemeinden/Kreise), leading to over/under-pricing and longer vacancy times.  
- Renters lack a transparent benchmark for “fair value”.  
- Spatial and quality factors (e.g., ÖV access, proximity to Zürich HB/Lake Zürich, amenities, noise) are not systematically quantified.

### 2. Objective
- Build a robust `machine learning mode` that predicts *asking net rent (CHF/month)* for apartments across the Canton of Zürich and explains key price drivers.

### 3. Research Question
- *To what extent can structural, locational, and environmental features explain and predict apartment asking rents in Zürich’s municipalities, and how accurate can predictions be at listing-time?*

### 4. Hypotheses
- **H1:** Location premium → rents increase the closer a unit is to Zürich HB, Lake Zürich, and dense amenity clusters.  
- **H2:** ÖV accessibility → shorter walking distance to S-Bahn/Tram correlates with higher rents.  
- **H3:** Quality/efficiency → newer builds, elevators, Minergie certification, balcony/parking add measurable premiums.

### 5. Expected Added Value of Data Analysis
- **Owners:** Optimal pricing → shorter vacancy periods, higher yields.  
- **Marketplaces/agents:** “Fair value” bands increase CTR and conversions.  
- **Renters:** Transparent benchmarks support negotiation and realistic filtering.  
- **Banks/insurers:** Better risk and collateral assessment for rental income.  
- **Organization:** Explainable insights support pricing and portfolio strategy.

# Use Case 2: Demand and Supply for Supermarkets in Swiss Municipalities

### 1. Problem Definition
- Lack of transparency on which municipalities are `underserved or overserved` by supermarkets.  
- Site selection and network expansion decisions rely on partial metrics (e.g., population only).  
- Risk of `cannibalization` between nearby stores and missed opportunities in high-demand zones.

### 2. Objective
- Quantify `demand–supply gaps` per municipality and recommend `where to open, resize, or rationalize` supermarkets by evaluating demoraphic, income, mobility, and competitive factors.

### 3. Research Question

- Which Swiss municipalities exhibit unmet grocery demand after controlling for population, income, mobility, tourism, and competitor presence, and what sales uplift or cannibalization should be expected for candidate sites?*

### 4. Hypotheses
- **H1:** Demand density → higher population, family size, and income increase grocery demand.  
- **H2:** Accessibility → fewer supermarkets within a 10–15-minute walk/drive indicates unmet demand.    
- **H3:** Seasonality → tourist areas show seasonal demand peaks.

### 5. Expected Added Value of Data Analysis
- **Network strategy:** Data-driven site selection → revenue growth with reduced cannibalization.  
- **Operations:** Right-size store formats, assortments, and opening hours.  
- **Logistics:** Optimize supply chains and last-mile efficiency.  
- **Customer value:** Better accessibility → improved satisfaction and loyalty.  
- **Finance:** Clear ROI projections for expansion or consolidation decisions.
